###a.What Server framework did you choose and Why?

I chose Ruby (Version 2.2.0) on rails( Version 4.2.0) due to the following reasons :-
1.It handles migrations, by using the Ruby DSL we can describe the changes to our database without writing the schema modification using SQL, which makes the schema database independent.	
2.It enables Rapid web application development due to the presence of built functions (pool of open source libraries (rubygems) )which helps the developers to build the sites quickly.Also Rubygems, makes it easy to create and share softwarelibraries that extend ruby, along with that it provides cross platform compatibility.
4.It has CGI scripts which can be easily implemented,presence of Rake script simplifies the testing.
5.Ruby has a low learning curve and it reduces the programming work and we can include more features with few lines of code i.e less coding, more functionality.
6.Easy Collaboration,as the contents of files are organized with a specific file structure which is remains same throughout every rails application.

###b.What client framework did you choose and why?
I chose JQuery on the client side to develop the web application due to the reasons listed below :-
1.Jquery makes DOM manipulation very easy as its easier to implement things using the existing DOM elements and improving them.
2.We can easily extend the objects and also it has the functionality to checks the available features on the user’s browser .
4.The pages written in Jquery take less time to load,as the jquery files are stored separately from the web page, the developers can easily make modification across the entire site.Also jquery gives you an option of loading div tags as and when they are required.
5.Its easier to learn,as it has  simple syntax and open coding standards which reduces the time to deploy the application.It also executes Ajax requests and Json call.

###c.What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
Using HTML and Integrating google maps and Charts into the web application was really easy.Google Chart require you to load the libraries, list the data to be charted, select options to customize your chart, even for the maps inbuilt libraries were required which was easier to implement.

###d.What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
The installation part was really time consuming,I had to install lot of packageswhich was really cumbersome.
 
###e.What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you Install, if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?
I didnt install any other component , its just to run my application disable theadd blocker if you have any.Bundle install command is used to prepare the serverside environment.

###f.What Ubuntu commands are required to deploy and run your server?
Execute the following Ubuntu commands to deploy and run the server :-
cd testapp
bundle install
rails s –v 0.0.0.0
